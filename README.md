Implementation of a semi-parametric minimum entropy estimator for regression analysis

As part of the ST4060 module (http://www.ucc.ie/modules/descriptions/ST.html#ST4060) offered at UCC I was tasked with implementing and testing a semi-parametric minimum entropy estimator for regression analysis. Here I have included the R code I used for the implementation and testing. I have also included a pdf document with the theory behind the implementation and the results of the testing.
